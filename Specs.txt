Hello,

Here are the features and requirements I need for our ecommerce website.

Easy and user friendly website to apply new merchandise onto the website with csv/xls format capabilities for bulk inventory transfer as well as single inventory upload.

The categories listed below need to allow my wife and I to manually put in different descriptions when needed. 

Website must have proper functionality to make this website complete; Here is a minimum of what's needed.

Product Name
Product ID / SKU
Model
Brand
Categories
Description box (have it work for seo capabilities as well)

Price
Tax Code

Variations (Colors)

Images (to upload images)


Date Available
Stock Quantity
Out of Stock Status (drop down menu)

Shipping and Delivery

Weight
Weight Class
Downloads

Website needs to look professional and polished as we discussed. Clean, professional layout with PayPal/Check out button/icon, social media links, phone number available on menu and footer, and have it look world class.

This should get the website going. Message me if you need anything.

Thanks,
Kris and Shannon
